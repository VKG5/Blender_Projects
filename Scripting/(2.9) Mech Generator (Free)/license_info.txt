Commercial usage of assets:
You are not allowed to re-sell the artwork that is distributed in the resources. 
You are allowed to package it as a smaller part of a commercial project like a game, 
but you can’t sell re-sell the models in their original form.

You are, however, allowed to sell the generation results if those results are only using parts that you yourself have created.

Strictly speaking, if it contains any of my artwork, then you are not allowed to re-sell it.
But if it’s using only your artwork, then you can sell it.
